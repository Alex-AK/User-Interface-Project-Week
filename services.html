					<p>A fan brush can be your best friend. Go out on a limb - that's where the fruit is. You need to have a very firm paint to do this. This is probably the greatest thing that's ever happened in my life.</p>
					<p>Trees grow in all kinds of ways. They're not all perfectly straight. Not every limb is perfect. Just pretend you are a whisper floating across a mountain. Paint anything you want on the canvas. Create your own worlds. There we go.</p>
